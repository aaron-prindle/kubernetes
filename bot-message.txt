Subject: SSA managedFields research updates and rationale

I reviewed your research artifacts and the 5 prior commits, then applied a targeted update pass to improve temporal accuracy, confidence framing, and recommendation safety.

New commits added:
1) 1f5031aec7e  research: refresh upstream status and references for managedFields
2) c2928562549  research: tighten conclusions and reprioritize mitigation strategy

What I changed

1) Updated stale "no server-side solution" claims
- Files:
  - research/05-online-research-findings.md
  - research/repro/report/report.html
  - research/10-references.md
- Rationale:
  - As of 2026-02-13 there is active upstream work for read-path omission (PR #136760).
  - Prior wording implied zero proposals/solutions existed; that is now stale.
- Result:
  - Reframed to: no merged comprehensive end-to-end server-side solution yet, but active exploration exists.

2) Added current upstream status section
- File:
  - research/05-online-research-findings.md
- Rationale:
  - Research should distinguish merged mitigations vs open work.
- Added:
  - #136760 (WIP omit managed fields get/list)
  - #131175 (no-op SSA metadata churn concern)
  - #131016 (scheduler trim fix)

3) Softened over-absolute quantitative claims
- Files:
  - research/04-memory-bottleneck-analysis.md
  - research/README.md
  - research/future-plan.md
- Rationale:
  - Existing percentages (20-40%, <5%, "dominant/root cause") were useful but too universal.
  - Better to mark as workload-dependent and require profile-backed validation.
- Result:
  - Kept directional conclusions but added confidence bounds and caveats.

4) Added explicit domain separation for memory interpretation
- File:
  - research/04-memory-bottleneck-analysis.md
- Rationale:
  - Prior text mixed apiserver heap, client/informer memory, and wire-size effects.
- Added section:
  - "Do Not Conflate These Three Buckets" (apiserver memory vs controller memory vs wire/serialization).

5) Re-ranked solution priority toward safer near-term path
- Files:
  - research/06-solution-proposals.md
  - research/README.md
  - research/future-plan.md
- Rationale:
  - "strip managedFields from watch cache" was positioned too early despite high correctness risk.
  - Active upstream momentum is currently on read-path omission.
- Result:
  - Priority now starts with read-path omission and churn reduction, then compression/prototypes.
  - Added risk matrix (correctness + delivery risk).
  - Marked watch-cache stripping as prototype/high-risk.

6) Added evidence gates before broad rollout
- File:
  - research/future-plan.md
- Rationale:
  - Ensure future work is backed by reproducible data and compatibility checks.
- Gates include:
  - memory evidence across workload shapes,
  - SSA correctness (ownership/conflict) non-regression,
  - client compatibility,
  - CPU/tail latency SLO checks.

Conclusion delta (important)
- Old conclusion tendency:
  - managedFields is THE dominant root cause and no server-side solution exists.
- Updated conclusion:
  - managedFields is a high-confidence, often major contributor;
  - impact magnitude is workload-dependent and must be measured;
  - upstream has partial mitigations and active work, but no merged universal fix yet.

What I intentionally did not change
- I did not remove your reproduction data or charts.
- I did not rewrite the large design sections beyond risk/priority framing.
- I did not alter your local repro scripts or measured results artifacts.

Suggested next step for you
- If you continue this track, run one more repro iteration that explicitly compares:
  - baseline,
  - managedFields read omission path,
  - no-op churn suppression candidate,
  - and only then prototype cache-separation.
